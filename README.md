### Contributing

The project is built in a way where nothing has to be done to start working.

The JavaScript is in the `script.js` file.
The styling is in the `style.css` file.

The code uses Materialize as a CSS framework and Google Maps for maps. 

(The package.json is used for adding typing in editors that support it like VSCode and WebStorm but is entirely optional).
